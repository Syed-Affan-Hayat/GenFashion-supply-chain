## Agent Design & Prompt Engineering

The GenFashion Supply Chain Copilot leverages a specialized agent layer to extract structured product specifications from free-text user input. This allows downstream supplier matching, logistics estimation, and ranking to be fully data-driven.

#### 1. Product Spec Extraction Agent
Agent Role: Product Spec Extraction Expert

Goal: Extract a clean JSON object with the following keys:
product_type, material, color, weight, season

Backstory / Instructions:
- Convert noisy product descriptions into a normalized JSON spec.
- Return only valid JSON with exactly the five keys.
- If a field is missing, set it to an empty string ("").
- No markdown, no commentary, no extra text.


This ensures consistency for downstream deterministic steps: material-based supplier matching, certification filtering, shipping calculation, and ranking.
